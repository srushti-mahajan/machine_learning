ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks with Hyperparameter Tuning on Alphabets Data
Overview
In this assignment, you will be tasked with developing a classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to classify data points from the "Alphabets_data.csv" dataset into predefined categories of alphabets. This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of ANNs and the significant role hyperparameter tuning plays in enhancing model performance.
Dataset: "Alphabets_data.csv"
The dataset provided, "Alphabets_data.csv", consists of labeled data suitable for a classification task aimed at identifying different alphabets. Before using this data in your model, you'll need to preprocess it to ensure optimal performance.
Tasks
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
●	Begin by loading and exploring the "Alphabets_data.csv" dataset. Summarize its key features such as the number of samples, features, and classes.
●	Execute necessary data preprocessing steps including data normalization, managing missing values.
2. Model Implementation
●	Construct a basic ANN model using your chosen high-level neural network library. Ensure your model includes at least one hidden layer.
●	Divide the dataset into training and test sets.
●	Train your model on the training set and then use it to make predictions on the test set.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
●	Modify various hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer, activation functions, and learning rate, to observe their impact on model performance.
●	Adopt a structured approach like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning, documenting your methodology thoroughly.
4. Evaluation
●	Employ suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate your model's performance.
●	Discuss the performance differences between the model with default hyperparameters and the tuned model, emphasizing the effects of hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation Criteria
●	Accuracy and completeness of the implementation.
●	Proficiency in data preprocessing and model development.
